Apple Inc.'s 2024 10-K filing highlights strong financial and operational performance, driven by its diverse product and service portfolio. For the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, Apple reported total net sales of $394.3 billion, with the services segment contributing $87.1 billion, accounting for 22% of total revenue. The Americas region led with $160.3 billion in sales (41% of total revenue), followed by Greater China at $93.3 billion (24%). The iPhone remains Apple’s dominant product, generating $205 billion, or 52% of total revenue. Meanwhile, Mac and iPad sales contributed $40.5 billion and $30.1 billion, respectively. Apple’s direct distribution channels, including its retail and online stores, accounted for 38% of net sales, while indirect channels, such as resellers, represented 62%.

Apple also faces substantial risks detailed in the filing. The company relies heavily on a concentrated supply chain, with manufacturing predominantly based in Asia, including China, India, and Vietnam. The global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions have exacerbated supply chain vulnerabilities. Additionally, compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act required significant changes to App Store policies, potentially impacting the services segment, which boasts a 70% gross margin compared to the company-wide gross margin of 44%. Apple’s market valuation, $2.63 trillion as of March 2024, underscores its resilience, but increasing competition in smartphones and services and exposure to macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and inflation, could challenge future profitability.`;
