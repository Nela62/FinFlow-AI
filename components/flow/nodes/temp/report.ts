Apple Inc.'s 2024 10-K filing highlights strong financial and operational performance, driven by its diverse product and service portfolio. For the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, Apple reported total net sales of $394.3 billion, with the services segment contributing $87.1 billion, accounting for 22% of total revenue. The Americas region led with $160.3 billion in sales (41% of total revenue), followed by Greater China at $93.3 billion (24%). The iPhone remains Apple’s dominant product, generating $205 billion, or 52% of total revenue. Meanwhile, Mac and iPad sales contributed $40.5 billion and $30.1 billion, respectively. Apple’s direct distribution channels, including its retail and online stores, accounted for 38% of net sales, while indirect channels, such as resellers, represented 62%.

Apple also faces substantial risks detailed in the filing. The company relies heavily on a concentrated supply chain, with manufacturing predominantly based in Asia, including China, India, and Vietnam. The global semiconductor shortage and geopolitical tensions have exacerbated supply chain vulnerabilities. Additionally, compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act required significant changes to App Store policies, potentially impacting the services segment, which boasts a 70% gross margin compared to the company-wide gross margin of 44%. Apple’s market valuation, $2.63 trillion as of March 2024, underscores its resilience, but increasing competition in smartphones and services and exposure to macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and inflation, could challenge future profitability.

The DCF model for Apple Inc. estimates the intrinsic value of its stock at $124.91 per share, indicating that the stock is overvalued by 45% compared to its current market price of $225.12. The present value of Apple's forecasted cash flows over the next five years is calculated at $560.8 billion, while the terminal value accounts for $1.3 trillion, resulting in a total present equity value of $1.9 trillion. This analysis assumes a discount rate of 8.39%, with a terminal growth rate of 0%, and evaluates cash flows using an equity-based free cash flow (FCFE) model.

Key financial projections include revenue growth from $422.5 billion to $538 billion over five years, with net income rising from $109 billion to $156 billion. Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) grows from $118 billion to $166 billion over the same period. Sensitivity analysis highlights significant valuation variability depending on changes in revenue growth, net margins, and discount rates, reinforcing that assumptions around financial performance and cost of capital are critical to the model's accuracy. These results suggest that Apple's current market price is significantly higher than its intrinsic value based on this DCF approach.
