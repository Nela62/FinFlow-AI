The DCF model for Apple Inc. estimates the intrinsic value of its stock at $124.91 per share, indicating that the stock is overvalued by 45% compared to its current market price of $225.12. The present value of Apple's forecasted cash flows over the next five years is calculated at $560.8 billion, while the terminal value accounts for $1.3 trillion, resulting in a total present equity value of $1.9 trillion. This analysis assumes a discount rate of 8.39%, with a terminal growth rate of 0%, and evaluates cash flows using an equity-based free cash flow (FCFE) model.

Key financial projections include revenue growth from $422.5 billion to $538 billion over five years, with net income rising from $109 billion to $156 billion. Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) grows from $118 billion to $166 billion over the same period. Sensitivity analysis highlights significant valuation variability depending on changes in revenue growth, net margins, and discount rates, reinforcing that assumptions around financial performance and cost of capital are critical to the model's accuracy. These results suggest that Apple's current market price is significantly higher than its intrinsic value based on this DCF approach.`;
