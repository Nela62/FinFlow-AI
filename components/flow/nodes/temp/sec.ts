Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly\nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\nsupply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and\ncan require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and\ndistribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new\nor changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be\nannounced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the\nCompany’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\n\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring\nmore frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity\nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and\ngeopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\n\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the\nCompany’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively\nimpact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\n\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and\nlose significant sales.

    text: "Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\n\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these\ninvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free.

The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating\ncosts, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from\ntime to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\nand can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure\nto additional regulatory and operational risks.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or\nat all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a\nparticular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the\nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source.

While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8",

When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.",

    text: "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,\nand expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are\nexpected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from\nincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities.

In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\nincreased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is\nvigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\nfrequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its\nbusiness practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film\nand digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,\nincluding electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the\nCompany’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or\nsupply chain.

These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\n\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13",

    text: "There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations\nor in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely\naffect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various\ntypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the\nCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\nrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business\npractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data\nis handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to\nlitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,\nthe Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry\ndata security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment\ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand.

The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.

    text: "Item 2.     Properties\n\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate\nfunctions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its\nexisting facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\n\nItem 3.     Legal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. The\nCommission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps\ndistributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the\nArticle 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation\nagainst the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the\nDMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of\nthe Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the\nCommission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the\nDMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance\nsmartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In\naddition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking\nmonetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company\nalleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction\nenjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple\nin-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a\nplan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance\nplan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the\nCompany filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to\nvigorously defend itself.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition or operating results.

    md: "# Item 2. Properties\n\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\n\n# Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n\n# Digital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\n\n# Department of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\n# Epic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\n# Other Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\n# Item 4.

The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from\ngeneral use.\n\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to\nincrease its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board.\n\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share\nbeginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax\nrate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to\ndisaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The\nCompany will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\n\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”),\nwhich will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker\n(“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss\ninformation in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using\na retrospective transition method.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that\naffect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final\noutcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have\na material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment.

    text: "Item 7A.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate                          Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument                   Rate Increase                                    Potential Impact                                                          2024             2023\nInvestment portfolio                   100 basis points, all tenors                     Decline in fair value                                          $                2,755   $        3,089\nTerm debt                              100 basis points, all tenors                     Increase in annual interest expense                            $                   139  $          194\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s\nunderlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivatives.\n\n                                                                                      Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27",

Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27",

    text: "Note 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.\nControl is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or\nservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\n\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\n\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\n\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material\nperformance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.\nThe second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri®®                                          and Maps. The\nCompany allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\nobservable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the\ndelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.\nRevenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be\nprovided.\n\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services.

    md: "# Note 2 – Revenue\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\n\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\n\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\n\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\n\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\n\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.

These restricted cash and cash\n            equivalents were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”).\n      (3)   As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, total marketable securities included $13.2 billion and $13.8 billion, respectively, held in escrow and\n            restricted from general use. The September 28, 2024 restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company’s obligation related to the State Aid\n            Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”).\n\nAs of September 28, 2024, 86% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities\nbetween 1 and 5 years, 10% between 5 and 10 years, and 4% greater than 10 years. As of September 28, 2024, 14% of the Company’s non-current mortgage-\nand asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 9% between 5 and 10 years, and 77% greater than 10 years.\n\nThe Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt\nsecurities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s underlying maturity.\n\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland\nto calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January\n2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus interest of €1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The\ntotal balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was €14.2 billion or $15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6 billion was\nclassified as cash and cash equivalents and $13.2 billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\n                                                          Uncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\n                                                          As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and\n                                                          numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was\n                                                          $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.\n\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48",

Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nwere effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\nsubmits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs.

Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein.

The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\n\n           2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an\nunfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n\n           3.    Vesting.

(Each\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\n\n           4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first\nVesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of\nthe Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a\npersonal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the\nCompany, in its sole discretion.

          "1. General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\n\n2. RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n\n3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\n\n4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\n\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without the Participant’s consent thereto.\n\n1",

In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:\n\n1. withholding from any wages or other cash compensation payable to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer;\n2. withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid upon vesting/settlement of the Award;\n3. arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;\n4. withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or\n5. any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method (b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.\n\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back.",

The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n\n3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).\n\n4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\n\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant without the Participant’s consent thereto.\n\n1",

The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n\n                      (b)      Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award\nthat are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to\nthe foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the\noriginal RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will\ncorrespond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend,\nhave either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n\n           6.     Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n           7.     Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the\nParticipant a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items. The\nCompany’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person\nentitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents\nor assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are\nsettled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n\n           8.    Effect of Termination of Service. Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as\nthe related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant’s\nTermination of Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its\nSubsidiaries (the “Severance Date”), regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause,\nvoluntarily or involuntarily or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date\nand the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash equivalent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\nthe event the Participant’s Termination of Service is due to the Participant’s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the\nVesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights)\ndetermined by multiplying (i) the RSUs subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but\nfor the Termination of Service and to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii) the Severance Fraction\n\n                                                                                              2",

Construction. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A\nof the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.\n\n           22.    Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal\nor otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n\n           23.

The Company may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision hereof.\n\n# 17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights.\n\nParticipation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to the RSUs and the settlement thereof and shall not be construed as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to the settlement of RSUs, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when settled hereunder.\n\n# 18. Section Headings.\n\nThe section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.\n\n# 19. Governing Law.\n\nThis Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California and applicable U.S. federal laws without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.\n\n# 20. Choice of Venue.\n\nFor purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made or to be performed.\n\n# 21. Construction.\n\nIt is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.\n\n# 22. Severability.\n\nThe provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.\n\n# 23. Imposition of Other Requirements.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.",

These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit\naward (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant\n(the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\n“Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\n\n           2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an\nunfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n\n           3.    Vesting.

Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first\nVesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award\nAgreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the\nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of\nthe Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\n\n           Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other\ncompensation or benefits.

The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n\n                      (b)      Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that\nare outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the\nforegoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original\nRSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend\nEquivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to\nany RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.\n\n           6.     Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n           7.    Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following each Vesting Date determined\npursuant to Sections 3 or 8 or following the Participant’s death as specified in Section 8(d) (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½)\nmonths after such Vesting Date or the date of the Participant’s death, as applicable), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a number of\nShares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event (or, in the case of the Participant’s Retirement or\nDisability, are scheduled to settle on such vesting event) less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the applicable Vesting\nDate pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent\nthat the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any\nrepresentations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan.

The\nCompany may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not materially and adversely affect the\ninterests of the Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a\nwaiver of any other provision hereof.\n\n           17.    Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided.

Choice of Venue. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties\nevidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that\nsuch litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern District of California,\nand no other courts, where this grant is made or to be performed.\n\n           21.

The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n\n                      (b)      Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award\nthat are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to\nthe foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the\noriginal RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will\ncorrespond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend,\nhave either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n\n           6.     Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n\n           7.     Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the\nParticipant a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event (or, in the case of the\nParticipant’s Retirement, death or Disability, are scheduled to settle on such vesting event), less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate\nprior to the Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the\ncondition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to\nthe Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have\nno further rights with respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n\n           8.

An Insider Trading Compliance Officer may not trade in Apple securities unless another Insider Trading Compliance Officer has pre-cleared the trade.\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors, executive officers and any other individuals subject to Section 16 (the “Section 16 reporting persons”) of the Act must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing profit transactions set forth in that section of the Act.",
